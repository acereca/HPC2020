\subsection{Measure Latency}
The MPI ping-pong implementation in \verb|code/src/latency.cpp| is measuring the roundtrip latency for each ping pong exchange 100000 times.
This results in the latencies observed in \autoref{fig:latency}.
Visualized in blue are the times for two ranks running on the same node, while the communication between two ranks on two different nodes is visualized in red.

\begin{figure}[ht]

    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/latency}
    \caption{Roundtrip Latency over 100000 ping-pong exchanges}%
    \label{fig:latency}
\end{figure}

Both times the Latency roughly increases linearly with message size and for the communication between nodes a distinct offset and worse latency scaling can be observed
