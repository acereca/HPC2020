The slurm scripts are stored inside \verb|code/slurm/|.

\subsection{Measure Latency}
The MPI ping-pong implementation in \verb|code/src/latency.cpp| is measuring the roundtrip latency for each ping pong exchange 100000 times.
This results in the latencies observed in \autoref{fig:latency}.
Visualized in red are the times for two ranks running on the same node, while the communication between two ranks on two different nodes is visualized in blue.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/latency}
    \caption{Roundtrip Latency over 100000 ping-pong exchanges}%
    \label{fig:latency}
\end{figure}

Both times the Latency roughly increases linearly with message size and for the communication between nodes a distinct offset and worse latency scaling can be observed

The scaling behaves worde by two magnitudes when comparing between node-to-node and inter-node communication.

\subsection{Measure Bandwidth}
The MPI flood-test implentation in \verb|code/src/bandwidth.cpp| is measuring the bandwidth over an averarge of 1000 messages, repeating this measurement 100 times.
This results in the bandwidths observed in \autoref{fig:bandwidth}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/bandwidth}
    \caption{Bandwidth over 100000 flood-messages}%
    \label{fig:bandwidth}
\end{figure}

Here a distinct increate in bandwidth is visible when communicating betyween two nodes.
Additionally the communication between two nodes seems to be capped at $\approx$\SI{111}{MB/s}, in which case the interconnect may be the reason (\SI{1}{Gb/s} minus additional overhead additional overhead).
{\bfseries No distinct difference between blocking and non-blocking send} is observable when communication between nodes.

For the communication within one node, a distinct difference between blocking and non-blocking send was observable, here the {\bfseries blocking send bandwidth was around \SI{30}{\%} higher }.
